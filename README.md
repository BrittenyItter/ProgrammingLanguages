# ProgrammingLanguages
# Summarize the project and what problem it was solving.
For this project, we were to create a display that showed the 12-hour clock as well as the 24-hour clock at the same time. The user needed to have the capability of modifying the times on the clocks as well. This program was intended for use with the international customers and domestic.

# What did you do particularly well?
I think that I utilized classes well for this project when it was not explicitly stated to do so.

# Where could you enhance your code? How would these improvements make your code more efficient, secure, and so on?
To enhance my code, I think I could utilize more trouble shooting techniques to make it more efficient. I think that I could also find a way so that the initial time is updated to the actual time so that it is more accurate. I could also make the display code more concise.

# Did you find writing any piece of this code challenging, and how did you overcome this? What tools and/or resources are you adding to your support network?
I found that syncing the times was a bit more challenging, but after taking some time to really think about it, I was able to figure it out.


# What skills from this project will be particularly transferable to other projects and/or course work?
As I was using classes for the first time, I have found that it is definitely a transferable skill. Switch statements are also very useful.

# How did you make this program maintainable, readable, and adaptable?
I was conscious of the whitespace in my code and tried to think of every angle that the code could be run.
